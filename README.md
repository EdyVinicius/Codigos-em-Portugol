# Portugol Code Repository

This repository contains a collection of codes developed in Portugol, ranging from the simplest to the more complex ones. All codes were developed on the Portugol platform, available at [portugol.dev](https://portugol.dev).

## About Portugol

Portugol is an educational programming language, ideal for beginners. It is based on pseudocode and facilitates the understanding of programming concepts. The codes in this repository can be executed in various code editors, but we recommend using the official platform [portugol.dev](https://portugol.dev) for the best experience.

## Repository Structure

The codes are organized in increasing order of complexity to facilitate progressive learning:

1. **Simple Codes:**
   - Basic examples of data input and output
   - Decision structures (if, else)
   - Loop structures (for, while)

2. **Intermediate Codes:**
   - Functions and procedures
   - Arrays and matrices
   - String manipulation

3. **Advanced Codes:**
   - Sorting algorithms
   - Complex data structures
   - Integrated projects

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Access the platform [portugol.dev](https://portugol.dev).
3. Copy and paste the desired code into the Portugol editor.
4. Run the code directly on the platform.
